# MassyTools

A data processing tool for targeted high-throughput MALDI-MS data extraction.

The tool has been described in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00658

The main MassyTools repository is at https://github.com/Tarskin/MassyTools

However, that version does not work correctly.

The version on git.lumc.nl is based on the lastest working Python 2 version,
and converted to Python 3.
